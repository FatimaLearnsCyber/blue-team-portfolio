# Project 3 – Phishing Email Analysis

In this project, I will simulate and analyze a phishing email attack using public tools and analysis techniques. I will extract indicators, analyze headers, and simulate user report-to-containment flow.

## Objectives
- Analyze a fake phishing email (headers, body, link).
- Use tools like VirusTotal, URLScan.io, and Any.Run for triage.
- Document the response workflow: user reports → SOC triage → containment.

## Tools Used
- VirusTotal (free)
- URLScan.io
- CyberChef
- Manual header decoding

## Outcome
- Build a phishing response playbook.
- Learn the signals that indicate phishing behavior.
