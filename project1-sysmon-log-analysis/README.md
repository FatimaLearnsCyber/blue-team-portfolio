# Project 1 – Sysmon Log Analysis (Windows 11)

In this project, I will install Sysmon on my Windows 11 VM and start collecting logs such as process creation, network connections, and PowerShell execution. I’ll generate test events and analyze them manually to understand normal vs. suspicious activity.
